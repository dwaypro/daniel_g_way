<p>There are some really good reasons to travel. Some of those reasons include, but are not limited to, personal development</p>

<h3>Some of those reasons include: </h3>

<ul>
	<li>Personal Enrichment</li>
	<li>Cultural Understanding</li>
	<li>Language Development</li>

</ul>

<p> A lot of people travel for reasons that can be really destructive, but a lot of fun. Sometimes it's best to do these in moderation, some not at all. </p>

<h3> Some of these reasons include:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>partying</li>
	<li>social status</li>
	<li>pride</li>
</ol>
